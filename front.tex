% Spatial methods are important for extremes
% Key points to our methods: Bayesian inference, low-rank approximations

In recent years, extreme values analysis (EVA) have started to benefit from methods that allow for dependence between observations.
In a spatial setting, this is important for many phenomenon (e.g. ozone, rainfall, wildfires) because spatial methods borrow information across space for informing inference and making predictions at unobserved locations.
When working with dependent extremes, max-stable processes are the analog to Gaussian processes.
Max-stable processes have generalized extreme value (GEV) marginal distributions.
These processes are exceptionally flexible, but they can be computationally challenging to work with for high dimensional data.

Some current methods address the dimensionality issues for max-stable processes using pairwise likelihoods, and others circumvent the computational challenges with low-rank approximations to max-stable processes.
While these provide feasible solutions, they can still be very slow to fit, and can be sensitive to distributional assumptions.
Despite these limitations, it is important to use models that are designed to handle dependence in the tail of the distribution.
Our contributions to the literature on spatial extremes are threefold. 

First, we develop a space-time \skewt method for threshold exceedances.
In this method, we use a censored, local \skewt process to model asymptotic dependence.
We use censoring so as not to allow the bulk of the data to influence the fit of the model in the extremes.
We introduce a partitioning to alleviate long-range asymptotic dependence.
We compare our method to Gaussian and max-stable processes with a simulation study.
We also conduct a data analysis of ozone measurements throughout the U.S. in July 2005.
We find that in most cases the method performs comparably or better than Gaussian processes and max-stable processes.

Second, we extend the GEV link for modeling binary data with a max-stable spatial dependence structure.
Traditionally, spatial methods for binary data use a latent Gaussian process to model dependence, but this may not be appropriate for rare data due to the lack of asymptotic dependence for Gaussian processes.
We compare our model to spatial probit and logistic methods through a simulation study.
We also conduct a data analysis of \emph{Tamarix ramosissima} and \emph{Hedysarum scoparium}.
We find some evidence to suggest that for very rare data, under certain sampling strategies, the max-stable extension provides an improvement in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

Lastly, we present a method to construct empirical basis functions (EBF) as a low-rank approximation for max-stable processes.
Similar to principal component analysis (PCA), these EBFs provide an exploratory method to examine important spatial trends as well as for Bayesian inference and predictions as unobserved locations.
One notable distinction from PCA is that these EBFs are not orthogonal due to the fact that they are restricted to be positive.
We demonstrate our method for a data analysis on wildfire data in the state of Georgia as well as precipitation data in the eastern U.S.
The results show that in the presence of spatial dependence, the EBF method demonstrates an improvement in quantile scores over a more traditional approach of using spatial knots with Gaussian weights.
